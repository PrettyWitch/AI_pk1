Considering the advantages of all recommendation systems, they are assembled into a hybrid recommendation system. Because it is not possible to search for the name and specific attributes of the fruit at the same time, it is divided into two search buttons.  

-Search 1: The user enters a specific name to search, compares all the attributes of the fruit, calculates the Pearson distance, and recommends the list of fruits with the highest similarity.

-Search 2: The user selects or enters the attribute parameters of the fruit, and recommends the most similar fruit list based on these attributes. In terms of price, allowing users to select a price range is a combination of the advantages of content-oriented recommendation systems and recommendation systems with parameter ranges.
Only calculate the Pearson distance of the attributes composed of "Imported", "Price", and "Sweetness", and recommend the list of fruits with the highest similarity.
Without considering all the attributes of the fruit into the search, the user's preference for a specific attribute can be determined, and the fruit can be recommended more specifically.
